 * - 1 byte	value length
 * - len bytes	value

 * - USPC_GET, USPC_GET_FULL must provide the command type and the setting key
 * - USPC_SET, USPC_SET_DEFAULT must provide the command type, the setting key, the length and the
 *   value
 * - USPC_LIST_SOME, USPC_LIST_SOME_FULL must provide the command type, the value length and the
 *   value as a list of 2 byte setting keys
