# User Settings

The user_settings lib is written to be agnostic to the list of settings used by an application. All
settings have a numeric ID, string key, type, value and default value (of the selected type). The
supported types can be seen in
[user_settings_types.h](./user-settings/include/user_settings_types.h). Please see the
[basic sample](./samples/basic/) for usage.

## Setup

1. To your `west.yml` add the irnas remote to the `remotes` section:

   ```yaml
   - name: irnas
     url-base: https://github.com/irnas
   ```

2. Then in the `projects` section add at the bottom:

   ```yaml
   - name: irnas-usersettings-lib
     repo-path: irnas-usersettings-lib
     path: irnas/irnas-usersettings-lib
     remote: irnas
     revision: <revision>
   ```

## Usage

To enable, please set `CONFIG_USER_SETTINGS=y` and fulfill the prerequisites. If
`CONFIG_USER_SETTINGS_SHELL` is enabled, settings can also be listed, got and set via the shell.
Type `usettings --help` to see the available commands.

User settings must first be initialized and then ALL the settings must be provided by calls to
`user_settings_add()` or `user_settings_add_sized()`. Calls to those two functions will allocate
into a private heap. If a setting can not be allocated, the library will assert. You are then
expected to increase `CONFIG_USER_SETTINGS_HEAP_SIZE` and try again. After adding all settings,
on_change callbacks can be registered. Then the settings should be loaded by calling
`user_settings_load()`.

```c
user_settings_init();

user_settings_add(1, "t1", USER_SETTINGS_TYPE_BOOL);
user_settings_add(2, "t2", USER_SETTINGS_TYPE_U8);
// ... (add more settings)

user_settings_load();
```

When calling `user_settings_load()`, each setting will be loaded with its value from NVS. If no
value was (ever) set, then a default value will be loaded.

The default value can be set by calling `user_settings_set_default_with_*()`. Keep in mind that a
default value can only be set once for each setting. To set a new default, NVS must be cleared
first.

Settings can then be get and set from within the application code - for that, the settings key/id
and type are expected to be known by the caller.

---

During development, you probably want to hardcode all your setting values by calling
`user_settings_set_with_*` for each setting during initialization and thus have all settings with a
valid value.

In a production device, settings should be provisioned into flash using
`user_settings_set_default_with_*`. When the application later boots, the defaults will be loaded,
and your can assume that all settings have a valid value.

If no default and no value exist for a setting, getting its value will return a pointer to zeroed
memory. In such cases, it is prudent to check if a setting has a valid value by using
`user_settings_is_set_with_*()`.

To check whether a setting has a default value, `user_settings_has_default_with_*()` can be used.
For this reason, it is suggested that each setting should have a value set (via its default value or
directly) during application initialization, so that later code can assume all settings have valid
values and can be read directly.

When you change the value of the setting, flag `has_changed_recently` is set. To clear this flag
call one of the functions: `user_settings_clear_changed_with_key(char *key)`,
`user_settings_clear_changed_with_id(uint16_t id)` or `user_settings_clear_changed(void)`.

## Iterators

You can iterate trough existing settings using iterator functions. Call `user_settings_iter_start()`
to reset iteration counters, then call `user_settings_iter_next(key, &id)` repeatedly to iterate
trough all settings. When function returns `false` you have reached the end.

You can also iterate only trough recently set settings, i.e. with set flag `has_changed_recently`.
Call `user_settings_iter_start()` to reset iteration counters, then call
`user_settings_iter_next_changed(key, &id)` repeatedly to iterate trough all settings. When function
returns `false` you have reached the end.

## JSON support

One can set multiple settings with JSON structure and export exiting settings, or settings changed
recently in JSON structure.

Enable JSON support by setting `CONFIG_USER_SETTINGS_JSON=y`. You will need cJSON support enabled as
well. `CONFIG_CJSON_LIB=y`.

To set multiple settings using JSON, create `cJSON *settings` object in the format:

```json
{
  "t1": true,
  "t2": 1000,
  "t3": "00000000",
  "t4": "banana"
}
```

and pass it to the set `function user_settings_set_from_json(settings)`. Function will set all
settings with existing key an correct value type.

To extract settings in JSON format call `user_settings_get_all_json(&settings)` and pass pointer to
`cJSON *settings` object. Keep in mind you are responsible to delete the object.

To extract only recently changed settings, i.e. with set flag `has_changed_recently` in JSON format
call `user_settings_get_changed_json(&settings)` and pass pointer to `cJSON *settings` object. Keep
in mind you are responsible to delete the object. Function will not reset the flag.

## Bluetooth Service

A user setting bluetooth service can be enabled by setting `CONFIG_USER_SETTINGS_BT_SERVICE=y`. See
the [bluetooth service sample](./samples/bluetooth_service) for details. The service uses the user
settings binary protocol under the hood. For the protocol definition, see
[here](./libraray/protocol/binary/README.md)

## Development Setup

If you do not already have them you will need to:

- [install west](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/latest/nrf/gs_installing.html#install-west)
- [install east](https://github.com/IRNAS/irnas-east-software)

Then follow these steps:

```shell
east init -m https://github.com/IRNAS/irnas-usersettings-lib irnas-usersettings-lib
cd irnas-usersettings-lib/project

# Set up east globally (this only needs to be done once on each machine)
east install nrfutil-toolchain-manager
# Install toolchain for the version of NCS used in this project
east install toolchain

# Run `west update` via east to set up west modules in the repository
east update
```

### Setup `pre-commit`

Turn on `pre-commit` tool by running `pre-commit install`. If you do not have it yet, follow
instructions [here](https://github.com/IRNAS/irnas-guidelines-docs/tree/main/tools/pre-commit).
